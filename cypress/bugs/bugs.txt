BUG 001:
    TITLE: Unable to use browser back button to return home.
    DESCRIPTION: The user can get confused if he needs to return to home and type again the number of people or zip code.
    The browser not allow the user to go back.
    Theres a small button called "Start Over", that allows to start the flow again. But is too small, and can cause mislead.
    STEPS:
        1. Access the Carbon Footprint Calculator web page;
        2. Type a valid number of people household;
        3. Type a valid zip code number;
        4. Click on 'Get Started' button, and you will be redirect to Home Energy form;
        5. Click on browser 'back' button, and see that nothing happens.

    Possible solution: Correct the browser back button behavior. Or change the layout and maybe position of the 'Start Over' button, to be more visible.
